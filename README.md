# E08b-Adding-Tiles

In this assignment we were tasked with adding to our tile game. When you run the game you will see that there are multiple rows now with different colors that have been assigned through different png images. Within the code we added nodes that have parent names and if those names are called then the tile with that color will appear. A lot of copying and pasting and placement was done in order to get the tiles alligned. Enjoy playing!
